An Arkanoid-style game built with Java, focusing on Object-Oriented Programming principles and Design Patterns.

---

## 🏗️ 1. Core Design Pattern: Strategy
The core game logic relies on the **Strategy Design Pattern** to handle brick collisions. This approach decouples the collision logic from the brick object itself, allowing for dynamic behavior changes at runtime.

### The Architecture
* **Interface:** `CollisionStrategy` (located in `brick.brick_strategies`)
* **Method:** `onCollision(GameObject obj1, GameObject obj2)`
* **Implementation:** The `Brick` class holds a reference to a `CollisionStrategy`. Upon collision, the brick delegates the behavior to its strategy.

    class CollisionStrategy {

        +onCollision(GameObject, GameObject)

    class PuckStrategy {
        +onCollision()
    }
    class CameraStrategy {
        +onCollision()
    }
